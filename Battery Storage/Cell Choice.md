## Battery Cell of Choice

The battery cell of choice is an 3.7 V, 2600 mAh LI-Ion Recharageable Battery
[[Li-Ion Cell](https://www.jaycar.co.nz/18650-rechargeable-li-ion-battery-2600mah-3-7v/p/SB2308)].

Update: Due to recent considerations of the use of simple boost converters
the cell of choice has been changed from a higher voltage low current Ni-MH
cell to a lower voltage but comparatively much higher current Li-Ion cell.

The new Li-Ion cell having 13 times the amp hour rating of the Ni-MH cell, with
just under half the DC voltage rating.
