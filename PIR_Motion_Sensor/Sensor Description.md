# PIR Motion Sensor Brief Description

The passive infra rodration (**PIR**) sensor measures infrared light radiating from objects within its field of view. Typically used in security and lighting applications.

The specific sensor in use for this project is an arduino specific PIR motion sensor module.
The sensor module employs three pins, GND, VCC, and OUT. These pins provide a ground connection
, input voltage, and the data output respectively. Additionally, the module includes two potentiometers
which allow the user to adjust the width of the operation range as well as the time delay for the output signal.

Additional information about the module in use can be found within its data sheet [PIR Motion Sensor](https://www.jaycar.co.nz/arduino-compatible-pir-motion-detector-module/p/XC4444?gclid=CjwKCAjwnZaVBhA6EiwAVVyv9K0IYv1tP7S_kaCKfKs1jRR3DNmrAktTTlTqNHujEH1mPeUIHG6HJhoCkC8QAvD_BwE).
