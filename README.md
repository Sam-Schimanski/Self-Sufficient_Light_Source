# Self-Sufficient_Light_Source
The design and build of a self-sufficient light source. Ideally powered by a wind turbine and controlled by a Pico microcontroller.

The purpose of this project is to design a self-sufficient light source that will be used to light the front of a house.
The switching on and off of the light will be performed by a PIR motion sensor and Pico microcontroller. The power generated for the controller, sensor,
and light will be supplied ideally purely by a roof mounter horizontal axis wind turbine (**HAWT**). Excess generation from the HAWT would be stored within a battery, to discharge out to the peripheral components e.g., controller, light, and sensor.
