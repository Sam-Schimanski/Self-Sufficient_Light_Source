Two light bulb choices were taken in for comparison for this project. The first being a "standard" light bulb suitable for any at home socket [[Regular Bulb](https://www.thewarehouse.co.nz/p/edapt-led-e27-classic-light-bulb-9w-cool-white-3-pack/R2733262.html?gclsrc=aw.ds&ds_rl=1268368&ds_rl=1268368&gclid=CjwKCAjwzeqVBhAoEiwAOrEmzYR_eyKCu1595M0PQq3uTocRSjo8KQu5t7SbOf_fopfRBaKLckj6xhoCnCgQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)].
The second being a low voltage bulb [[Low Voltage Bulb](https://www.liquidleds.com.au/products/4-watt-12-volt-fancy-round-g45-dimmable-led-filament-light-bulb-e27?gclid=CjwKCAjwquWVBhBrEiwAt1Kmwt45sR3A0kkG7pg0l-bPMKw2y6W-FygZxoLcmJDk2elwIOLXmFRkDBoCBvUQAvD_BwE&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google)].



| Bulb Type    | Input Voltage [V] | Input Current [A] | Power Consumption [W] |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| **Standard**      | 230 - 240       | ~0.039 - 0.0375 | 9 |
| **Low Voltage** |    12 - 24     | ~0.33 - ~0.167 | 4 |

The initial plan was to use a standard bulb found in any old home socket. This was to make sourcing a replacement bulb easy and cheap.
Although as can be seen above the input voltage for a standard blub is very high for a hobby project due to being sourced from mains
traditionally. Although, this also comes with an advantage of relatively low current draw from the bulb.

The use of a standard bulb would require the use of a step up transformer to meet the voltage requirements. This requires not only additional hardware but also
a very specific transformer, a 1:16 transformer would meet the requirements given a ~15V input. Upon inspection the nearest transformer that would meet the winding ratio
requirements would be unable to accomodate the input voltage. Any alternative step up transformer that could meet all requirements would be far beyond the budget
for any singular component in this project. Therefore, the use of a standard bulb in conjunction with a step up transformer within this project is not feasible.

The alternative low voltage bulb offers a far reduced inpout voltage at the cost of a slightly increased input current. Both of which being much more manageable
within this project. Although, this bulb is far more scarce than the standard home blub makes part replacement a slight issue. Additionally, these bulbs come at approximately
twice the price of standard blubs but in comparison to the step up transformer required for the standard bulb, this is the best of the available options.
